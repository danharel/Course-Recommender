Let's pretend we have an input matrix of length 100,000 x 200,000. Each row represents a movie, while each column represents a user. This matrix is far too large for comfort. 

Ideally, instead of having one column represent a single user, we could have one column represent a particular "feature", or combination of features and have signficantly less values. 
Let's say, for example, we have 40 features. Instead of having a single 100,000 x 200,000 matrix X, we have two matrices: 
- 100,000 x 40 matrix U representing each movie's correlation to each feature.
- 200,000 x 40 matrix V representing each user's correlation to each feature.
If we use the 40 most "significant" features, then X ~= UV.

A user's affinity for a particular movie is simply the dot product of the user's feature vector and the movie's feature vector. By calculating all of these and sorting them, we can determine the best "fits" for a user. Alternatively, by determining U and V, we can multiply them together to find X^, which provides approximate predictions for each user-movie pair.
So all we need to do is find U and V.

"Singular value decomposition is just a mathematical trick for finding those two smaller matrices which minimize the resulting approximation error--specifically the mean squared error (rather convenient!)." -http://sifter.org/~simon/journal/20061211.html

Methods for predicting a user's rating:
- Find the most similar users, then use their ratings to predict the user's rating
- Fill in all blanks in the matrix with an educated estimate. Perform partial SVD to find U^ and V^, then multiply them together to get A^, an approximation of each user's rating for each course.
- "Netflix Try This At Home". Train each feature by following the gradiant on given values until convergence. This is an alternative way of approximating U^ and V^.
- http://menugget.blogspot.de/2012/10/dineof-data-interpolating-empirical.html -- Fill all gaps with 0. Calculate RMSE between OG dataset and new data set (only on known values). Perform partial SVD with k = 1 and multiply U^ and V^. Calculate RMSE. Calculate change in RMSE. Increase k by 1. Repeat until RMSE converges or until you've performed "too many" iterations.

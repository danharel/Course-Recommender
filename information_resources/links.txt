    - After one year, the "Progress Prize" was awarded
        - Matrix Factorization (which the community generally called SVD, Singular Value Decomposition)
        - Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM)
        - 8.43% increase
    - Originally use Cinematch
    - Netflix use case is a bit different from ours. 
        - Significantly more date (billions of users, thousands of shows/movies)
        - Designed for family use
            - Provides recommendations for multiple people, each with their own personal preferences
    - Ranking
        - f(u,v) = w1 * p(v) + w2 * r(u,v) + b
            - f = ranking
            - u = user
            - v = video
            - p(v) = popularity
            - r(u,v) = predicted rating
            - b = bias
